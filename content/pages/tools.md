Currently OCW contains a bunch of link-wrapped images like the first one below.  
They get screwed up when you save. (Extra escapes)

\[

{{< resource d76bb2ff-8097-4548-ca14-2acc42d17b0c >}}

\]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials/function4view1)

 

We are going to convert them to these things, which will not be screwed up when you save:

{{\< resource uuid="d76bb2ff-8097-4548-ca14-2acc42d17b0c" href\_uuid="756fad96-a8b6-cb78-2c0f-1b8a186d2e8e" >}}

{{\< resource uuid="d76bb2ff-8097-4548-ca14-2acc42d17b0c" href="https://www.mit.edu" >}}

 

no difference at all that I can see
